This file, maparoms.txt, serves as a ROM map for "La abadía del crimen." It details the contents of the various .bin files that make up the game, providing a high-level overview of how the game's assets and code are organized on disk.

Here's a breakdown of its function:

- File Content Description: It lists each abadia*.bin file and describes the data it contains. This includes everything from the game's presentation and code to graphics, music, text, and even a Z80 debugger.
- Data Organization: For each file, it provides memory address ranges (offsets within the file) and explains what is stored in those ranges. For example, abadia3.bin is shown to contain character sprites, music data, game text, and initial game settings, all at specific locations within the file.
- Asset Location: The file acts as a guide for locating specific game assets. If a developer wanted to find the graphics for the monks, the music for the final scroll, or the game's presentation code, this map would point them to the correct file and the relevant section within it.

In summary, this file is a crucial piece of documentation for understanding the game's file structure. It complements game_memory_map.txt by showing what data is stored in the game's files, whereas game_memory_map.txt describes how that data is arranged in active memory during gameplay. This map is essential for anyone looking to analyze, modify, or reverse-engineer the game.
